## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST contains 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, divided into 10 categories of clothing items such as T-shirts, trousers, sneakers, and more.

The goal is to leverage CNNsâ€™ ability to extract spatial features from images to accurately classify these clothing items.
